# QuoteLink for Safari Extension

This Safari extension is perfect for those who want to efficiently share web page information as a quote. It automatically adds the source URL to the text you select, making it easy to copy and share on social media. When you need to quickly convey accurate information, this app is a powerful tool to support you.

## Installation & Uninstallation

### Installation
To install the extension, go to Settings > Apps > Safari > Extensions, or enable the extension by toggling it on in the Manage Extensions option found in the Safari address bar.

### Uninstallation
To uninstall the extension, similarly to the installation process, toggle the extension off, or remove it completely by selecting the extension icon on the Home Screen and choosing "Delete app".

## Acknowledgments

The inspiration for this project came from two bookmarklets I developed and shared on GitHub Gist. You can view them [here](https://gist.github.com/hkitago/67ed3a91c7941ab9a2c6b657bac692cb) and [here](https://gist.github.com/hkitago/1009207b098773cf0a29b76636eb03c5). I would like to acknowledge the role of these bookmarklets in shaping the idea for the QuoteLink extension and helping to bring it to fruition.
