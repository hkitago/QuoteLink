This Safari extension significantly streamlines the process of web page citation. Instead of repeatedly copying and pasting text and URLs, simply select the text and press the extension button to automatically generate a citation with the source URL. It can be quickly utilized for various purposes, such as creating papers, presentation materials, saving important recipes, or noting interesting information for later reference.

Copying to clipboard and sharing on social media can be completed with a single click. It will prove to be a useful tool that enables efficient and reliable work when creating documents that require source recording and citation.

## Installation & Uninstallation

### Installation

To install the extension on iOS or iPadOS, go to Settings > Apps > Safari > Extensions, or enable the extension by toggling it on in the Manage Extensions option found in the Safari address bar.
For macOS, open Safari, go to Safari > Settings > Extensions, and enable the extension from there.

### Uninstallation

To uninstall the extension, similarly to the installation process, toggle the extension off, or remove it completely by selecting the extension icon on the Home Screen and choosing "Delete app".

## Usage

1. Load the web page.
2. Select the text on the web page.
3. Tap the icon next to the address bar and choose the extension.
4. A window will slide up from the bottom on iPhone, or a pop-up window will appear on iPad and Mac; select an action and tap it.

Notes:

- If you do not select text within the web page, the page title will be used.
- If you enable the extension and it doesn't function correctly, please refresh the page, or close and restart the app, and try again.

## Known Issues

- There is a rare issue where the extension may not work when a URL is passed from the in-app browser feature of other apps, such as RSS or social media apps, to Safari for display.
- If the extension does not function correctly immediately after installation, particularly on iPhones, restarting Safari or refreshing the relevant page may resolve the issue. This behavior stems from technical limitations, with the design prioritizing battery life and device performance. Appreciation is extended for users' understanding, and the team stands ready to implement any forthcoming Apple updates that might resolve this issue. (Which may be improved with the 1.4 release.)

The inspiration for this project came from two bookmarklets I developed and shared on GitHub Gist. You can view them [here](https://gist.github.com/hkitago/67ed3a91c7941ab9a2c6b657bac692cb) and [here](https://gist.github.com/hkitago/1009207b098773cf0a29b76636eb03c5). I would like to acknowledge the role of these bookmarklets in shaping the idea for the QuoteLink extension and helping to bring it to fruition.
